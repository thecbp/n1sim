# n1sim 

A simulator for N-of-1 data with realistic run-in and washout of treatment effects. This can be considered to be an extension of the code built by Percha et al. 

I built this because I thought it might be useful to have for future research. I always have a need to simulate N-of-1 data, so this will come in handy.

# Things to implement

- non-Gaussian outcomes
